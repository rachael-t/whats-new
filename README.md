# What's New?


## Abstract

 This [project](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-3/whats-new.html) was a four-day solo project during Module 3 at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/).

 For this project, I was tasked with building out my first React application. This simple news application allows a user to search news articles based on topic, as well as search for articles within a given topic. 

## Setup

1. Fork this repository.

2. Clone your forked repository.

3. Change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running `npm install`

4. Check that it is setup correctly by entering `npm test` in your terminal. All tests should be passing.

5. In your terminal, run `npm start` and then navigate to the local host that has been opened in your browser.


## Technologies Used

## Learning Goals

* Write clean, well factored code using ES6 syntax.

* Learn to pass information between components using props.

* Learn to write readable JSX.

* Use propTypes for every component receiving props.

* Learn how to unit test React components including smoke testing, methods, and changes in state.



## Future Iterations

* Add styling for menu topic selection to stay highlighted.

* Instead of importing the news data from the data directory, use the Fetch API to get the data.
